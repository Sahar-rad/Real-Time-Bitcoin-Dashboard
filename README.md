## Overview

The **Real-Time Bitcoin Dashboard** addresses the need for real-time cryptocurrency price tracking and analysis. By leveraging **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI**, it creates a seamless pipeline that retrieves, processes, and visualizes Bitcoin price data in real time.

This project is designed for:
- **Cryptocurrency analysts** looking for actionable insights.
- **Traders** needing real-time updates for decision-making.
- **Enthusiasts** eager to understand Bitcoin price trends.

### Key Benefits:
- **Instant access** to live Bitcoin price data.
- **Comprehensive analytics** for trend evaluation.
- **Reliable decision-making** through real-time insights.

### Power BI Service Export: DirectLakeSemanticModel.Report

This repository includes the **DirectLakeSemanticModel.Report** folder, synchronized directly from Microsoft Fabric to GitHub. The folder contains JSON files and metadata representing the Power BI dashboard configuration.

#### Contents of DirectLakeSemanticModel.Report
- **definition.pbix**: Metadata describing the structure of the Power BI report.
- **report.json**: Detailed JSON configuration of the report, including visuals, layouts, and data sources.
- **StaticResources folder**: Additional assets supporting the dashboard.

#### Purpose
Including these files provides:
1. **Configuration Review**: Analyze the report's structure and setup through JSON files.
2. **Version Control**: Collaborate efficiently by tracking changes via GitHub.
3. **Documentation**: Ensure transparency of the dashboardâ€™s design and logic.

By exporting directly from Microsoft Fabric to GitHub, this repository integrates the development and deployment of Power BI dashboards into a modern, collaborative workflow.

## Data Flow

### 1. Source Data (API)
- Retrieves real-time Bitcoin price data.

### 2. Event Stream
- Streams data using Azure Event Hub.
- Processes data with Event Stream for analytics.

### 3. Managed Fields
- Adds fields like:
  - **Day**
  - **Month**
  - **Week**

### 4. Aggregation
- Calculates:
  - **Minimum Price**
  - **Maximum Price**
  - **Average Price**

### 5. Data Activator
- Monitors metrics for threshold breaches.
- Triggers **email notifications** for significant price changes.

### 6. Lakehouse
- Stores processed data for further analysis.
